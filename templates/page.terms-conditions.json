These terms tell you what you need to know about buying with us. If you think that there might be a mistake in these terms, please let us know. We may revise these terms and conditions without notice by posting revised terms and conditions of sale on our website. The terms and conditions posted on the website at the time you place your order will govern that purchase. \n</p>\n\n<p>1. Who we are and how to contact us</p>\n\n<p>1.1 Who we are. We are UCORE Ltd – a company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with company number 09776961. Our head office is at 550 Valley Road, Basford, Nottingham, United Kingdom, NG5 1JJ and our registered VAT number is GB 448413193.</p>\n\n<p>1.2 How to contact us. You can contact us at: https//ucore.co.uk/contact</p>\n\n<p>1.3 How we may contact you. If we must contact you, we will send an email to the email address you provided to us when placing your order online or via our app or when making your purchase in store.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>2. Placing an order</p>\n<p>2.1 How you can place an order. Orders are placed through our website or our app. Once you have added the product(s) you would like to your basket, you will go through our checkout procedure where you will need to enter your contact details, delivery, and billing information. Please check and double check your order (e.g. the product(s), size(s), and delivery address) before clicking the “complete order” button or the “pay now” button.</p>\n\n<p>2.2 Acceptance of your order. Your order is an offer from you to us to buy the product(s) in your basket. After you place an order, you will receive an email from us confirming that we have received it. Our official acceptance of your order takes place when we email you to confirm we have dispatched your product(s). It is at this point that a contract will come into existence between you and us. When we acknowledge your order, we will also confirm your order number. If you need to contact us about your order, you should quote the order number.</p>\n\n<p>2.3 Restrictions on placing orders. To order our products, you must be at least 18 years old and be authorised to use the payment method which you use to pay for the products you order. If you are under 18, you may place an order only with consent of a parent or guardian.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>3. Our rights to cancel your order</p>\n<p>3.1 If we cannot fulfil your order. In the unlikely event that we’re unable to fulfil your order (e.g. because the product is out of stock, we haven’t been able to verify the billing information you’ve provided, you have requested delivery to a country that we do not currently ship to, or there has been an error in the pricing or description of the product), we’ll let you know by email and we won’t charge you for the product.</p>\n<p>3.2 Unusual or suspicious activity. We provide our products for your personal use only. We may cancel an order if we notice something unusual or suspect that our products are being exploited for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose. If this happens to you and you think we have made a mistake, contact our customer service team through our online form at: https//ucore.co.uk/contact. </p>\n<p>3.3 Suspending the supply of products. We may have to suspend the supply of a product to you to:</p>\n<p>3.3.1 deal with technical problems or make minor technical changes.</p>\n<p>3.3.2 update the product to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and/or</p>\n<p>3.3.3 amend the product as notified by us to you.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>4. Our products</p>\n<p>4.1 What we provide. We provide Urban and Athleisure wear, including streetwear clothing and accessories.</p>\n<p>4.2 Descriptions of our products. The pictures of our products (and packaging) on our website are for illustrative purposes only. We work to ensure that colours are displayed accurately but we cannot guarantee that a device’s display of the colours exactly reflects those of our products.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>5. Delivery</p>\n<p>5.1 Delivery destination. Unfortunately, we currently ship to the following countries: Mainland Europe (including the UK), America, Canada, and Australia.</p>\n<p>5.2 Delivery costs. All the information about our delivery charges can be found here: https://ucore.co.uk/delivery charges.</p>\n<p>5.3 Additional charges. Any customs, duties or additional charges which apply to your order (if your order is delivered outside of the UK, for instance) will be your responsibility and are not included in the delivery costs.</p>\n<p>5.4 When we will provide the products. When we deliver the products to you will depend on the delivery method you select during the order process, please refer to our delivery timings here: https://ucore.co.uk/delivery methods. If you are buying products during promotional periods, it may take a little longer for our products to be delivered to you.</p>\n<p>5.5 We are not responsible for delays outside our control. If delivery of the products to you is delayed by an event outside our control (e.g. because of postal/courier delays, logistics or severe weather), we will let you know as soon as possible. If there is a risk of substantial delay, you can contact us to cancel your order, and we will refund you for any products you have paid for but not received.</p>\n<p>5.6 If you are not available when the product is delivered. If no one can take delivery and the products cannot be posted through your letterbox, the courier will notify you of the delivery attempt and tell you how to rearrange delivery or collection of the products.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>6. Your rights to end the contract\n</p>\n<p>6.1 You can always end your contract with us. Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract, as set out below. We are under a legal duty to supply products that are in conformity with this contract and nothing in these terms will affect your legal rights.</p>\n<p>6.2 If what you have bought is faulty or differs substantially from how it is described on our website. You may have a legal right to end the contract (or to get the product replaced or to be given a refund). In this case, the return will be free in the United Kingdom provided you return the product to us within 30 days (unless stated otherwise on our website) from the date you receive it.</p>\n<p>6.3 If you want to end the contract because of one of the reasons set out below, the contract will end immediately, we will refund you in full for any products which you have paid for, but which have not been supplied to you. The reasons are:</p>\n<p>6.3.1 we have told you about an upcoming change to the product or these terms which you do not agree to;</p>\n<p>6.3.2 we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered, and you do not wish to proceed;</p>\n<p>6.3.3 we have told you that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;</p>\n<p>6.3.4 we have suspended supply of the products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than four weeks; or</p>\n<p>6.3.5 you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.</p>",
